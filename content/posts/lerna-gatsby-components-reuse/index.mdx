In my latest project, I'm using monorepo structure using lerna. I'm sharing some common components
between two different frontend projects. One of them is a Gatsby project that is causing the
problem. The project's structure looks like this:

```bash
.
├── packages
│   ├── admin # CRA based project
│   │   └── package.json
│   ├── frontend # Gatsby based project
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── ui # common UI elements
|       └── package.json
├── lerna.json
└── package.json
```

At a root level, I'm installing common dependencies for the project. Those are packages like
`react`, `react-dom` and `@material-ui/core`. It's a common practice for lerna projects: you only
need to install those once, saving your time while reinstalling dependencies.

## The problem

My `frontend` package is the one using `gatsby` and local `ui` package. When trying to run the
project via `gatsby develop` while importing some components from `ui` I got a blank gatsby page and
errors like these in the console:

```js
Uncaught Error: Unable to find node on an unmounted component.
// or:
Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation
```

I've found out that despite not having `react` in `frontend`'s package.json it was found in
`packages/frontend/node_modules`! Based on `package-lock.json`, it turned out it was required by
`gatsby`. The errors I got were caused by two different React instances being present on a live
site: one from Gatsby, and the other one from my ui components. I needed to find a way to have only
one `react` in my project - despite Gatsby's
[`peerDependencies` requirements](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/package.json):

```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "react": "^16.4.2 || ^17.0.0",
  "react-dom": "^16.4.2 || ^17.0.0"
},
```

## The solution

I didn't exactly found a solution not to install React with Gatsby. I did, however, found a good
enough workaround.

It turns out that `npm` follows symlinks while resolving dependencies. There is a small utility
package called [`npm-link-shared`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-link-shared) that does exactly
that. I could overwrite the forcefully-installed React with this command:

```bash
npm-link-shared ../../node_modules . react react-dom
```

This solution worked, but could be improved. In `frontend/package.json` I've added this code:

```json
"scripts": {
  "preinstall": "rm -rf ./node_modules",
  "postinstall": "npm-link-shared ../../node_modules . react react-dom"
}
```

The `postinstall` script ensures that dependencies will be linked after each `npm install` call.

The `preinstall` script ensures a clean installation. I was getting some errors related to a
presence of symlinks that `npm` was not expecting.

This solution was tested on `npm@6` and is in use in production. It wouldn't work with
`react-native` thought, as it doesn't follow symlinks when building the application.
